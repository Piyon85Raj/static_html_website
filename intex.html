   <p>The Ramanathaswamy temple is a must-see for every traveller. The temple is equipped with a towering 38-metre ‘Gopuram’ and has a majestic, imposing structure, extensive corridors, and elegantly carved pillars. The temple itself was built by rulers since the 12th century, with Sethupathy Maravar beginning construction of the grand Ramanathaswamy temple, which boasts of the ‘Third Corridor,’ which was completed by his successor</p>

   <p>The tranquil shallow water-spread of the sea, which is only 100 metres in front of the temple gopuram, is revered. A plunge in the Agnitheertham is thought to cleanse pilgrims of their sins. Pilgrims also value the various theerthams (holy water tanks) in and surrounding the temple.</p>

   <p>The 2.2-kilometer-long bridge between Rameswaram Island and the mainland is India’s longest bridge built over a bay. Pamban Bridge is another name for it. Similarly, the railway SCISSORS bridge linking the island is notable for its one-of-a-kind opening to allow ships to pass across the water.</p>
